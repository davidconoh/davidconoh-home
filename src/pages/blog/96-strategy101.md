**`We are innovation — and by all means, trending hacks. — We bring you a holy squadron of intellectuals, defined by nature as brilliant minds. Don't get it twisted!`**

It’s 2020 and I’m going through digital innovation courses across hosted platforms, right after a couple hell years of hosting events around tech communities and building strategies for learning in the local city of **Aba, Nigeria**. Today, however, I explore those interests in an adventurous way, like exchanging insights for funds through legitimized channels, or developing software for programming and academic purposes.

`Throughout this entire episode, one word presents itself as a benchmark for the successful execution of projects in the modern world. Coupled with the spin-off on global targets,` **#Inclusion** `has been on the lips of everybody in the tech industry for quite some time, so it only makes sense that I have my fair share of a bite on this trend --.`

## Inclusion — A key to diversity trends
When I mention Inclusion as a trend, I tend to identify every person subject to this change. Our ability to be purposeful is a natural exhibition of character and personnel, to take advantage of development practices and put them to good use is a trend, so I talk of diversity as a whole new world of multipurpose and accessibility to various tools and services.

* Quality code promoting diversity of ideas and inspiration.

* Best approach to learning by competing one another in providing exemplary services in the open.

* Best-in-class marketing by delivering quality to multiple divisions at once.

* Multiple support programs for best-in-class users and developers across other time zones.

Let me know what you think in the comments.

**`Bringing you engagements, digital technology enveloped in new brands and ideas for your exposure through `*Science*` and` *Artificial Intelligence*`. The use of `*AI*` as a tool to modify culture and inexperience call for the need to divide true inspiration from the others and quality data from substandard ones to bring about better insights, reliable actions, and improved work benefits.`**
